# Class - Object


## Abstraction
- Talks obout general thing and avoid the specific case


## Encapsulation
- Encapsulation refers to integrating data (variables) and code (methods) into a single unit. 
- In encapsulation, a class's variables are hidden from other classes and can only be accessed by the methods of the class in which they are found
- Is used to limit the access to variable inside the 
- User of object should not know how it internally works
- Modifier are used to limit the access


## Inheritance


## Polymorphism
 - Having many form
 - Types of polymorphism
   - Dynamic polymorphism
     - Method overriding
   - Compile time polymorphism
     - Method overloading - same name but different set of parameter

## Function vs Method

| Function                                                              | Method                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Function is set of instruction or procedures to perform specific task | Method is set of instruction that are associated with object |
| Function is independent functionality                                 | Method lies in object}                                       |
| Function can work with provided data                                  | Method can access all the data provided in given class       |

## Parameter vs Argument

| Parameter                                                              | Argument                                               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Parameter are the variable that can be defined in function declaration | Arguments are the variable given to function execution |
| Referred as the formal parameters                                      | Referred as actual parameter                           |
