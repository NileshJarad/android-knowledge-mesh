/**
 * Real world Adapters
 * Iterators and Enumerators
 * Iterators are more recent part of Collections
 *   - hasNext() - checks if any more elements are present
 *   - next() - get's the next element
 *   - remove() - removes the current element
 * Enumerators are older interfaces allowing
 *  - hasMoreElements() - checks- if any more elements are present
 *  - nextElement() - returns next element from collection
 *
 *
 *  For both these interfaces having been implemented in two different versions of Java,
 *  Compatibility based on the requirement can be made possible with Adapters
