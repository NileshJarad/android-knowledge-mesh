Apart from the coding, I have mentored junior developers, let the team during major app re-writes, involved in system design discussion. What excites me most is solving the real world problem through the technology and constant learning new tools and technology to say ahead in mobile space.

Currently I am looking for the more technical challenged , work with cutting edge technology and  contribute to product tha reached global scale , I find very aligned with your team at [Company name]

### Why are you looking for the job change

**Example 1**

I have had fulfilling journey of past 5 year in ed tech domain, Where I contributed to  impactful product and grown technically and professionally. But i think growth comes with steeping out of comfort zone and taking new challenges.

[Company name] caught my attention because the scale at which the technology is applied to real world problem, especially in domain like Automotive. I am excited to work with cutting edge technology, collaborate with diverse team.  

So for me it's not leaving anything but learning new curve and contributing in high-impact environment. 

**Example 2**

I've been working in the EdTech domain for the past few years, and while it's been a valuable experience, the industry has been facing some challenges lately in terms of growth and stability. Over the last 5 years, I've gained solid experience, and I now feel ready to take on more challenging work that allows me to grow technically and expand my skill set. Unfortunately, my current organization doesn't support internal movement between teams, which limits my ability to explore new technologies or contribute in different capacities. I'm now looking for a role where I can work on impactful projects, keep learning, and stay aligned with the latest industry trends.

## Conflict between manager

**Example 1**

In my current organisation, I experienced the situation where me and my manager had different working style. 
I prefer more of independent approach, where I can plan and execute the task keeping stakeholder informed at key checkpoints.
My manager had more of hands-on style which sometimes felt like micromanagement.

At first it created some tension, as I felt it was impacting my productivity and confidence. 
Instead of letting the conflict grow. I decided to keep candid but respectful discussion with my manager. 
I shared how i work best when trusted with accountability and ownership, 
while also keeping in mind about their need to visibility and control.

To align better we decided to on regular daily standups ,  weekly connects and posting day work status before leaving the day.
This gave me the autonomy which i was looking for.
That small shift improved our collaboration significantly and strengthened our profession relationship.


What I learned from that experience is the value of proactive communication and adaptability—recognizing that conflict doesn’t have to be negative, but an opportunity for growth and better mutual understanding.

**Example 2**

In a previous role, I experienced some tension with my manager due to micromanagement. I prefer working with autonomy, while my manager had a more hands-on style. Instead of letting it affect work, I initiated an open conversation to align our expectations. We agreed on regular check-ins, which gave them visibility and gave me the space to work independently. It improved our collaboration, and I learned how effective communication can resolve most conflicts

## How do you handle a conflict between two colleagues?

When I notice a conflict between colleagues, I first try to understand the root cause by listening to both sides without judgment. I believe most conflicts arise from miscommunication, so I focus on creating a space where each person can express their perspective clearly.

If needed, I help mediate by finding common ground and encouraging a solution-focused discussion. I avoid taking sides and instead guide the conversation toward what’s best for the team and the project.

In my experience, being calm, respectful, and neutral helps de-escalate tension and restore collaboration quickly."
