My expertise in Android stack spans from core java, kotlin to modern frame work like Jetpack Compose,, coroutine and coin, I have been actively involved in architecture design, following clean code architecture and MVVM pattern to ensue the maintainable and testable code.

Apart from the coding, I have mentored junior developers, let the team during major app re-writes, involved in system design discussion. What excites me most is solving the real world problem through the technology and constant learning new tools and technology to say ahead in mobile space.

Currently I am looking for the more technical challenged , work with cutting edge technology and  contribute to product tha reached global scale , I find very aligned with your team at [Company name]


### Why are you looking for the job change

**Example**

I have had fulfilling journey of past 5 year in ed tech domain, Where I contributed to  impactful product and grown technically and professionally. But i think growth comes with steeping out of comfort zone and taking new challenges.

[Company name] caught my attention because the scale at which the technology is applied to real world problem, especially in domain like Automotive. I am excited to work with cutting edge technology, collaborate with diverse team.  

So for me it's not leaving anything but learning new curve and contributing in high-impact environment. 

## Conflict between manager

**Example**

In my current organisation, I experienced the situation where me and my manager had different working style. 
I prefer more of independent approach, where I can plan and execute the task keeping stakeholder informed at key checkpoints.
My manager had more of hands-on style which sometimes felt like micromanagement.

At first it created some tension, as I felt it was impacting my productivity and confidence. 
Instead of letting the conflict grow. I decided to keep candid but respectful discussion with my manager. 
I shared how i work best when trusted with accountability and ownership, 
while also keeping in mind about their need to visibility and control.

To align better we decided to on regular daily standups ,  weekly connects and posting day work status before leaving the day.
This gave me the autonomy which i was looking for.
That small shift improved our collaboration significantly and strengthened our profession relationship.


What I learned from that experience is the value of proactive communication and adaptability—recognizing that conflict doesn’t have to be negative, but an opportunity for growth and better mutual understanding.
