# Tree

Tree is hierarchical (Non-Linear) data structure.

## Tree concepts (terminology)

- **Root** - Top most element in tree
    - A is root of tree
- **Node** - Which store the information
    - A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M
- **Parent** - who having child below it
    - G is parent of L and M
    - B is parent of E and F
- **Child** - having parent
    - L and M are child of the G
    - H is child of D
- **Leaf Node** - having no child
    - I,J,K,F,L,M and H
- **Non-Leaf Node (Internal Node)** - having at-least one child
    - A, B,C,D,E nad G are Non-Leaf node
- **Ancestor** - Any predecessor from root node till that node
    - Ancestor of L are G,C and A
    - Ancestor of H are D and A
- **Descendants** Any predecessor from that node till leaf node
    - Descendants of C are G,L and M
    - Descendants of C are E,I,J, K and F
- **Siblings** - All children of same parent
    - E and F are siblings
    - B, C and D are siblings
- **Degree** - No of children of node
    - Degree of A is 3
    - Degree of G is 2
    - Degree of D is 1
    - Degree of L is 0
- **Depth** - Length of longest path from root to that node (no of edges)
    - Depth of F is 2
    - Depth of L is 3
    - Depth of D is 1
    - Depth of A is 0
- **Height** - length of longest path till leaf node
    - Height of B is 2
    - Height of A is 3
    - Height of D is 1

## Types of tree

- [Binary tree](BinaryTree.kt)
    - A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the
      left child and the right child.
    - Nodes in a binary tree are arranged in such a way that each node can have at most two children.
    - Binary trees are widely used in computer science for efficient searching and sorting algorithms.

- Complete Binary Tree
    - A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level,
      which is filled from left to right.
    - In a complete binary tree, all nodes are as far left as possible, except possibly for the last level, which is
      filled from left to right.
    - Complete binary trees are useful in representing data with heap structures, and they have efficient array-based
      representations.
- Full Binary Tree (Proper Binary Tree)
    - A full binary tree is a binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children
    - In other words, a full binary tree is a binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children, but never 1
      child.
    - Full binary trees are used in various applications, such as expression trees and decision trees.
- Perfect Binary Tree:
    - A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which all internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaf nodes
      are at the same level
    - In other words, a perfect binary tree is both full and complete.
    - Perfect binary trees are rare in practice but are used in some theoretical analyses and algorithms.
- Balanced Binary Tree
    - A balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the height of the two subtrees of any node never differs by more
      than one.
    - Balancing ensures that the height of the tree remains logarithmic with respect to the number of nodes, leading to
      efficient operations such as search, insertion, and deletion.
    - Balanced binary trees are used in various data structures such as AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees.

- [Binary search tree - BST](BinarySearchTree.kt)
    - It is Binary tree.
    - It has special property that left and right of tree should be BST
    - All node in Left subtree should be less than **Root**
    - All node in Right subtree should be larger than **Root**
    - Equal value can be put in left or right but not in both
    - **In-Order traversal of BST will always sorted**
    - Search is faster in **_average_** case **O(log N)**. It depends on height of three (skewed tree)
- [AVL tree (Self balancing BST)](AVLTree.kt)
    - Skewed binary search tree gives birth to AVL
    - Is a Binary tree
    - |Height of left tree| - |Height of right tree| = {-1,0,1} --(Balance factor)
- B tree
- B+ tree
- Heap tree
- Red Black tree

## Tree traversal

- **Pre-Order** (Node, Left, Right)
- **In-Order** (Left, Node, Right)
- **Post-Order** (Left, Right, Node)
- **Level Order Traversal**
- [Traversal's code](Traversal.kt)

### Question on the tree

- [Check if tree is BST](CheckIsBst.kt)
- Print left view of the tree
- Print right view of the tree
- Print top view of the tree
