# Recursion
- Function calling itself is called recursion
- It divides big problem into sub-problems
- **Tail-recursion**
  - Tail recursion is a concept in computer programming where a recursive function makes its recursive call as the last operation before returning. In other words, the recursive call is in the "tail" position of the function.

## Points to remember
Every recursion has below two properties
1. Recursion has base case (Exit condition)
2. Logic for problem

[Recursion direction](RecursionDirection.kt)
- Going towards base case
    ```kotlin
        // base condition
  
        // your logic
  
        // call recursion
    ```
- Coming back from base case
    ```kotlin
        // base condition
  
        // call recursion
  
        // your logic
    ```
