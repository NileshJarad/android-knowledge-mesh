/**
 * Find the Median of a Number Stream
 *
 *
 * Mean, median, and mode
 *
 * Mean: The "average" number; found by adding all data points and dividing by the number of data points.
 * Example: The mean of 4,1 and 7 is (4+1+7)/3 =  4
 *
 *Median: The middle number; found by ordering all data points and picking out the one in the middle
 * (or if there are two middle numbers, taking the mean of those two numbers)
 *
 * Example: The median of4,1 and 7 is 4 because when the numbers are put in order
 *
 *Mode: The most frequent numberâ€”that is, the number that occurs the highest number of times
 *
 * Example: The mode of {4,2,4,3,2,2,}4 is 2 because it occurs three times, which is more than any other number.

/**
 * Time complexity #
 * The time complexity of the insertNum() will be O(logN) due to the insertion in the heap.
 * The time complexity of the findMedian() will be O(1) as we can find the median from the top elements of the heaps.
 *
 * Space complexity #
 * The space complexity will be O(N) because, as at any time, we will be storing all the numbers.
