# Queue

- Stack data structure which allow Last In Fist Out (FIFO)
- Insertion the operation made at one end and remove operation made at front

### Operation of Queue
- **Enqueue** - The enqueue operation adds an element to the rear of the queue.
- **Dequeue** - The dequeue operation removes the element from the front of the queue


### Application of stack


### Time complexity


| Operation | Time complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Insert    | O(1)            |
| Delete    | O(1)            |
| Search    | O(N)            |
| Access    | O(N)            |
| Peek      | O(1)            | 


### Question for the Stack
- [Implement stack using list](stack.kt)
- [Reverse string using stack](reverse_string.kt)
- [Reverse string word using stack](reverse_string_words.kt)
- Balancing Bracket
- Reverse stack without using another stack
- Sort stack without using another stack
- Delete intermediate item from stack
